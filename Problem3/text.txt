Fixed filter Logic:
    Ensured balances are filtered by positive amounts and valid priority (getPriority(balance.blockchain) > -99).

Simplified useMemo:
    Removed redundant dependencies (prices aren't directly used in sorting or filtering).

Improved Sorting Logic:
    Simplified sorting to a single comparison for descending order.

Enhanced Type Annotations:
    Added missing blockchain type in WalletBalance and ensured all type annotations align with the actual data usage.

Consistent Formatting:
    Used .toFixed(2) for consistent decimal places, which is common for financial data display.

General Refactoring:
    Cleaned up imports and clarified the role of each component and hook used in the WalletPage.
